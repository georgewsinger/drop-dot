# 1 Project Dropbox History

## 1.1 What I did.

1. [ ] Moved entire life to Dropbox folder. 
2. [ ] Used scripts to help symlink {~/.config_files} to Dropbox folder.
3. [ ] Old programs: Wrote list of existing programs and cross-installed. //ATTEMPTED to bash-script automate this but failed
4. [ ] New programs: Use SSH scripts to cross-install new pacman/yaourt programs.

## 1.2 Software Written

1. `delink_local_home.sh` //contains single function which replaces {~/.symlinks} with {~/.actual_addresses}.
2. `project_dropbox_functions.sh` //OLD and none of these were used
3. **Soft linking function.**

  ```
  function fmvlns() {
    mkdir -p $(dirname $2)
    sudo mv $1 $2
    sudo ln -s $2 $1
  }
  ```

## 1.3 What is Needed



# 1.4 Lessons Learned

- Dropbox uploading takes a LONG time.
- Most of my scripts I didn't use because I didn't trust them.

# 2 Unprocessed

- "drop-dot" //"How to Sync Your Unix Configuration Files and Plugins with Dropbox" //put a drop logo on it





First, choose where you want your configuration files to go:

//dir and file paths
`dot-drop drop ~/.config $OPTIONAL_LOCATION` //~/.config -> $D/$HOME/.config
`dot-drop link ~/.config $OPTIONAL_LOCATION` 

//file directories (supposing `~/.drop-droprc is populated with list`
`dot-drop drop`
`dot-drop link`
